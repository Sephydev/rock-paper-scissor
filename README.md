# Rock Paper Scissors

This project is part of the The Odin Project curriculum.
It consist of using what we learned during the Javascript sections of the Foundation module to make a Rock Paper Scissors web app.

A [Live Demo](https://sephydev.github.io/rock-paper-scissor/) is available.

## What was the most easy part ?

The most easy part for me was 99% of the project, because I already have basic knowledge in Javascript. I decided to do this project as a reminder of this knowledge.

## What was the hardest part ?

The hardest part was to refactor playRound to adapt it for multiple rounds.
When adding the UI, the hardest part was to combine all the JavaScript, DOM and Events knowledge in order to get a clear and optimized code.
